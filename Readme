# A.Space Resource Booking System

## Overview
This is the complete Google Apps Script (GAS) source code for the A.Space Web Application. The system is designed to manage time-slot reservations for various company resources (rooms, desks, vehicles) and utilizes a Google Sheet as its primary database.

## Core Features
- **User Authentication:** Login, Password Change, Forgot Password (OTP), and SSO for GMAIL accounts.
- **Resource Management:** Inventory and status tracking for Rooms, Desks, Seats, and Vehicles.
- **Reservation Logic:** Time-based conflict checking to prevent double-booking.
- **Admin Workflow:** Pending approval system and utilization reporting.
- **Notifications:** Automated email and Google Calendar integration.

## Files
- `Code.gs`: Contains all the Apps Script backend logic.
- `index.html`: Contains the main user interface (HTML/CSS/JS).

**Note to Professor/Reviewer:** This project is deployed as a Google Apps Script Web App. The corresponding Google Sheet (used as the database) is not included here but is required for the application to run.
